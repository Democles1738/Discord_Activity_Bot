# Discord_Activity_Bot
This is a bot that will read the message history of a discord server and will print out a list of all active and inactive members
This bot can talk to multiple servers at once, type !help to see all the commands and the syntax for them
This bot cannot and will not kick people out of a server, It's not set up for that nor are the security checks in place to make sure that it doesn't get abused. Currently anybody can call this bot and call it's functions, so if you use this bot to figure out who is active and who isn't active, all you will get is a list of names and the category. The kicking will have to be done by an admin
To use this code, you must enter your token in the very last line or else it won't run
